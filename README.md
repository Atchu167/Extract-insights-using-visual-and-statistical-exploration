# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. It focuses on identifying key factors that influenced passenger survival.

Files Included:
`train.csv` â€“ Training dataset (labeled)
`test.csv` â€“ Test dataset (unlabeled)
`gender_submission.csv` â€“ Sample submission file
`Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` â€“ Summary of findings in PDF format
'untitled0.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with full code and visualizations

EDA Highlights:
Survival Count â€“ Overall survival rate is ~38%.
Gender Impact â€“ Females had a survival rate of ~74%, males only ~18%.
Class Impact â€“ 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
Age Distribution â€“ Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.
Fare Correlation â€“ Higher fares were associated with increased survival chances.
Embarkation Port â€“ Majority of passengers boarded from Southampton.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
